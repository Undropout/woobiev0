# Resume/Cross-Device Fix Summary

## Problem
Users logging out and back in (or switching devices) get stuck in loops or have to re-answer questions because:
1. Pages depend on localStorage which doesn't persist
2. Pages don't check if answers already exist in the database
3. resume.html doesn't properly set localStorage before redirecting

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ 1. bio/index.html (FIXED)
- Removed localStorage requirement warning
- Added database fallback to fetch matchID if localStorage is empty
- Now works cross-device

### ✅ 2. tier1a/tier1a.js (FIXED)
- Added database fallback for matchID/username
- **Added check for existing answers** - if user already submitted, skip to review phase
- Users won't have to re-answer questions

### ⚠️ 3. tier1b/tier1b.js (NEEDS FIX)
**Same pattern needed:**
```javascript
// After line 52, replace localStorage check with:
let matchID = localStorage.getItem('woobieMatchID');
let localWoobieUsername = localStorage.getItem('woobieUsername');

if (!matchID || !localWoobieUsername) {
  // Fetch from database
  const snap = await get(ref(db, `users/${currentUserId}/currentMatch`));
  const matchData = snap.val();
  matchID = matchData.matchID;
  localWoobieUsername = matchData.username;
  localStorage.setItem('woobieMatchID', matchID);
  localStorage.setItem('woobieUsername', localWoobieUsername);
}

// Then check if answers already exist:
const existingAnswers = await get(userAnswersRef);
if (existingAnswers.exists()) {
  // Skip to review/waiting phase
  questionBlock.style.display = 'none';
  completionMessage.style.display = 'block';
  waitForBothAnswers();
  return;
}
```

### ⚠️ 4. tier2/tier2.js (NEEDS FIX)
**Same pattern** - check localStorage, fallback to database, check for existing answers

### ⚠️ 5. tier3/index.html (NEEDS FIX)
**Same pattern** - check localStorage, fallback to database, check for existing answers

## Testing Checklist
After all fixes:
- [ ] Logout during bio → login → should continue to bio page
- [ ] Logout during tier1a questions → login → should NOT re-ask questions
- [ ] Logout during tier1a review → login → should go back to review
- [ ] Logout during tier1b questions → login → should NOT re-ask
- [ ] Logout during tier1b review → login → should go back to review
- [ ] Logout during tier2 questions → login → should NOT re-ask
- [ ] Logout during tier2 send → login → should go back to send page
- [ ] Logout during tier3 questions → login → should NOT re-ask
- [ ] Test on DIFFERENT DEVICE (different browser, incognito, phone)

## Key Pattern
All tier pages need:
1. Try localStorage first
2. If empty, fetch from `users/{uid}/currentMatch`
3. Check if answers already exist in database
4. If yes, skip to review/waiting/vote phase
5. If no, show questions
